<p>This has been achieved by searching all mammalian protein structures for cysteine pairs with thiols within 10 &#8491; of each other in the RCSB protein databank. Finally, known redox-active disulphides were used to determine parameters for prediction of further such disulphides.
<h2>HSE - Half sphere exposure</h2>
HSE is a measure of the accessibility of an amino acid side-chain. C&#x3B1; atoms are counted in a 12 &#
; radius around the C&#x3B1; of each cysteine in the potential redox-active disulphide bond. A lower HSE means an amino acid has fewer proximal amino acids, so is more accessible.
<h2>Redox Score</h2>
The redox score for each potential redox-active disulphide is calculated from factors including the HSE and distance between each thiol in the cysteine pair. The highest redox score is 1.82, and the lowest redox score of a known redox-active disulphide is 0.25, while the lowest score overall is 0.1.
<h2>Duplicates</h2>
A particular cysteine pair often features in multiple structures, which would lead to duplicates. To remove duplicates, cysteines were assigned to a residue number in their UniProt sequence, then the structure where the cysteine thiols are closest to each other is chosen for that potential redox-active disulphide.
<h2>Exclusions</h2>
Some structures or cystein pairs have been excluded. Reasons include:<ul>
<li>The distance between the thiols in the pair was too short (< 1.7 &#8491) to be considered real. </li>
</ul>
