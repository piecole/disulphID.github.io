<p>ReDisulphID is a bioinformatics tool that uses available structural data to predict the presence of redox-active intermolecular disulphide bonds in proteins.
<br><br>This has been achieved by searching all mammalian protein structures for cysteine pairs with thiols within 10 &#8491; of each other in the RCSB protein databank. Finally, known redox-active disulphides were used to determine parameters to rate potential novel redox-regulated disulphides with a % redox score.
<br><br>Please note that only <b>inter</b>molecular disulphides are predicted, not <b>intra</b>molecular disulphides.</p>
<h2>HSE - Half sphere exposure</h2>
<p>HSE is a measure of the accessibility of an amino acid side-chain. C&#x3B1; atoms are counted in a 12 &#8491; radius around the C&#x3B1; of each cysteine in the potential redox-active disulphide bond. A lower HSE means an amino acid has fewer proximal amino acids, so is more accessible. Usually HSE is expressed as two separate C&#x3B1; counts from half-spheres facing towards the side chain or towards the backbone, but in this case the two numbers have been added together for a the total HSE.</p>
<h2>Redox Score</h2>
<p>The redox score for each potential redox-active disulphide is calculated from solvent accessibility, pK<sub>a</sub>, and distance between each thiol in the cysteine pair. The highest redox score is 100.0, and the lowest redox score of a known redox-active disulphide is 65.7, while the lowest score overall is 0.</p>
<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<p>A particular cysteine pair often features in multiple structures, which would lead to duplicates. To remove duplicates, cysteines were assigned to a residue number in their UniProt sequence, then the structure where the cysteine thiols are closest to each other is chosen for that potential redox-active disulphide.</p>
