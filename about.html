<p>Redox-active disulphides have emerged as key regulators of protein function, making them important both physiologically and in disease. They can be targeted as nucleophiles by covalent drugs, which can mediate potent biological effects.

(<b>Re</b>dox <b>Disulph</b>ide <b>ID</b>entifier) 
is a bioinformatic tool that uses available structural data to predict the presence of novel redox-active disulphide bonds in mammalian proteins.
<br><br>This has been achieved by searching all mammalian protein structures for cysteine pairs with thiols within 10 &#8491; of each other in the RCSB protein databank. Finally, known redox-active disulphides were used to determine parameters to give a rating to potential novel redox-regulated disulphides, this rating is in the form of a % redox score.</p>
<h2 id = "hseinfo">HSE - Half sphere exposure</h2>
<p>HSE is a measure of the accessibility of an amino acid side-chain. C&#x3B1; atoms are counted in a 12 &#8491; radius around the C&#x3B1; of each cysteine in the potential redox-active disulphide bond. A lower HSE means an amino acid has fewer proximal amino acids, so is more accessible.</p>
<h2 id = "pkainfo">Minimum pK<sub>a</sub></h2>
<p>The lowest pK<sub>a</sub> from each thiol in the cystiene pair. A lower minimum pK<sub>a</sub> means a cysteine pair is more likely to form a redox-regulated disulphide bond. The pK<sub>a</sub> of the cysteine thiols in the potential redox-active disulphide bond are calculated using the <a href = "https://github.com/jensengroup/propka" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>PROPKA algorithm</a>.</p>
<h2 id = "scoreinfo">Redox Score</h2>
<p>The redox score is related to how likely a cysteine pair is to form a redox active disulphide. It is calculated from solvent accessibility, pK<sub>a</sub>, and distance between each thiol in the cysteine pair. The highest redox score is 100.0, and the lowest redox score of a known redox-active intermolecular disulphide is 70.86, while the lowest score overall is 0.</p>
<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<p>A particular cysteine pair often features in multiple structures, which would lead to duplicates. To remove duplicates, cysteines were assigned to a residue number in their UniProt sequence, then the structure where the cysteine thiols are closest to each other is chosen for that potential redox-active disulphide.</p>
<br><br><p>The most recent structure in this database is from 2023-01-11.</p>
